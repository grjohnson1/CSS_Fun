# CSS Fun
This is a repository of pure HTML and CSS based on varous readings and subscriptions that I have. I will give credit to the author and a link. Please note that I take the time to make alterations in my version so that I can get to know the code.

Mainly this is for a quick reference guide for myself to grab in the future.
